            <p>You will be given the enemy's random number at the start of the game. 

                    <p>There are four league members below. By clicking on a league member you will add a spedific amount of points to your total score.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your score goes above the random number. When you win or lose, the enemy will chose another random number.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The  value of each league member is hidden from you until you click on it. You'll need to do some math to figure out the value of each additional league member after you've clicked the first one.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each time the game starts, the game will change the value of the league members.</p>
